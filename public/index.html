    <h1> What’s not vegan about booze?</h1>
    <p>Of course, if an alcohol contains honey or other obvious animal ingredients it’s not vegan, but there are quite a few hidden animal ingredients in the alcohol-making process. Just as bone char can be part of the sugar-refining process, animal products can be part of making beer, wine, or liquors.<p>

    <p>Beer and wine are the usual suspects when it comes to hidden animal ingredients, but not all liquors are vegan, so it’s worth looking up, just in case. Here are some of the animal ingredients that go into boozy drinks that you really have no way of knowing about unless you ask the company:

<li>isinglass – gelatin made from fish bladders
gelatin</li>
<li>egg whites (aka albumin)</li>
<li>casein (a milk protein)</li>
<li>carmine – this is used for color and is made from crushed beetles</li>
<li>sugar – this is mostly in liqueurs, where they add sugar to sweeten the final product. Since some sugar isn’t vegan, some liqueurs that contain sugar also are not vegan.</p>
</li>
