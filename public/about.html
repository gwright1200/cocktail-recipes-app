 <p> Hello my Name is Gisselle. Veganism is life how I know it, I'm for all things vegan.    </p> 

<p>My backstory I was an impressionable kid in the 3rd grade.The assignment was given to research the diets of hog,swain,the pig.  </p>

<p> Through books,videos and stories told by my mother, she worked on an farm in the summer when she was an young child. It became very clear eating meat was would be soon off limits for me. 

<p>You have since then boom, I was instantly an vegetarian. Iconic words for kid to say at that time.Most recently I decided to be vegan an couple years ago. 
</p>

<p> Fast forward living vegan and being an adult. I enjoy an cocktail occasionally to my surprise. I learned all beers, wine and liquors aren't created equally. In an state of dismayed when found animal by-products were used in some popular cocktails.</p>

<h4>Wine Tales</h4>

<p> When I discovered this devasting news, my research when extensively and my mission was to get the word out to as many people as possible. Vegan activist in the making. Go figure , i'm passion about that things that I can change.</p>
 
 <p>Today is information age , I took to all the sites Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. Spreading the word to anyone and everyone who listened.</p>

 <p> My mission was to let every person know if you going to endulge in an adult beverage its very possible.It could possibly certain addictives and filters made with animal by-products.</p>

<h4>Vegan cocktails </h4>

<p> Provide an recipe for your favorite cocktails by simply entering adding an few simple ingredients.</p>

<p> Basically taking all the guesswork out of the is it vegan or not. You select your choice of wine, beer or liquor and list the ingredients and this application will provide with an fabulous recipe.</p>

<p> Over 30 different recipes to experience with so enter your ingredients and lets create some magically drinks.
Most hard liquors are vegan FYI. Beer and wine have more filters so you just have to be cautious if that your drink of choice.</p>

</h4> Conclusion</h4>

<p> Either if your vegan or not you have responsibilty to yourself to know all the ingredients that are in your 
  cocktails. Just doing your part when you order an nice cold one ... beer or and chilled glass of bubbly wine that substance is what order and nothing more.
